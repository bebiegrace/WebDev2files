        <p>When you eat <b>rice cake</b> with your family and friends, it always tastes better!</p>

        <p> <b>Rice cake</b> is a type of baked rice cake from the Philippines. It is usually eaten for<br>
               breakfast,especially during the Christmas season. It is traditionally cooked in clay pots lined<br>
               with leaves. It is a subtype of kakanin (rice cakes) in Philippine cuisine. <i>Bibingka</i> is also<br>
               found in Christian communities in eastern Indonesia.</p><br>

          

        <p> <b>NESC (Nai Ebing Sweet Corner)</b> business started in <b>1957</b>. Rice cake is their  family<br>
             delicacy. Our <i>‘grandlola’</i> <b>Lamberta Saranillo</b> started the food business, when she got<br> 
             married,she managed it herself and with the help of our great² <i>lolo</i> she made her business grow and
            she got a lot of satisfied customers.<br>

        </p>
        <p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, people have been hustling for work, finding no time to invest in their wellbeing.
           Last <b>May 2021</b> we decided to start the business which is called <b>NESC (Nai Ebing’s Sweet Corner)</b>, and 
           because of its unique and delicious taste <b>Nai Ebing’s Sweet Corner</b> got lots of customers until this rice cake
           business became known  not just in <b>southern Cebu</b> but moreover in Cebu City we've got a seller there which is a
           journalist in  Brigada News.</p><br>
          

         <p><b>NESC (Nai Ebing’s Sweet Corner)</b> was named after <b>Eduvigis Taypin</b> who was the second daughter of <b>Lamberta Saranillo</b>. 
            When Lamberta  died,  Eduvigis Taypin continued the rice cake business. <b>NESC </b>busines is located at 'barangay'
            <b>Bugas, Badian, Cebu</b> and now they are currently selling delicious rice cakes and creating different new recipes.</p><br>

         <p> And now they are looking forward to more great opportunities and small successes in their business.</p>
