                <h1>About Me</h1>

                <p>Each of us has our own story. Some people sacrifice, hurt, hopeless, contented, blessed
                    and in some way other individuals didn’t know yet whether he has been blessed or being
                    punished. But in all that we have experienced or gone through, there’s always reasons behind
                    that will lead us on the right path.
                    My parents named me Bebie Grace Balbuena, but when I asked my mother about it, since
                    as for me it’s a little bit weird and she just said that it was a nice name so I didn’t bother to
                    ask
                    anymore. Nevertheless, you can call me Bebie to make it more comptable and easy to utter. I am
                    a simple person living in Manduyong, Badian, Cebu and formerly studying at Badian National
                    High School Poblacion, Badian, Cebu. When I was in grade school, I only had a few friends who
                    are my male cousins as I was a very stilly school girl and not that approachable to any other
                    individuals, unless they were asking questions then that’s the time that I had to talk. But when I
                    was already in high school, I learned to socialize and make friends with other students, I don’t
                    know how but it was just happening. Until the time comes I was given the opportunity to come
                    here in Passerelles Numeriques (PN), and I think I have improved a little bit when it comes to
                    my behavior. As for me, I guess I became friendly and somehow approachable than before as
                    they were also good and affable individuals too.</p>

                <p> My father was killed when I was just nine years old, because of what happened. It feels
                    like my world's turn upside down. From that moment, everything had changed and it really broke
                    my heart seeing my mother hurt and suffer. After that struggle, my mother was no longer staying
                    just like she used to before, but rather she needed to go somewhere in the city to find a job. And
                    there was also lots of chaos between our two relatives regarding my father’s death. My older
                    siblings also prefer to stop their studies for the meantime and just help my mother instead, for us
                    to survive. Yet years had passed, we were already used to it, living without my father’s guide and
                    presence, but I know in my heart that aside from God, he had been always there for us too in
                    good times and in bad times. All that experience, now I can say that no matter how hard our life
                    is, God will give us many different ways and options to survive to have a better future someday.
                    Moreover, what motivates me the most is my goals and how my family supports and
                    trusts me that I can do things no matter how hard it is for me to handle. They believed that I am a
                    strong person and can be a woman whom they can be trusted and rely on especially if they can’t
                    be able to make it anymore then it’s time for me to do my part. Furthermore, while I’m here in</p>

                <p>Passerelles Numeriques (PN), honestly I didn’t promise anything but I’ve always put this in my
                    mind that I shouldn’t forget my responsibilities and the reasons why I am here in this prominent
                    organization. Also in times of difficulties or challenges as we can’t avoid these in our journey, I
                    must not lose courage and shouldn't change as years pass by, but still always be a good person
                    just like I am in the past. After her in PN, I will find a suitable job for me and then try my very
                    best to support my loved ones in many different ways. From that day forward I should plan for
                    my future and do the things that I always wanted to do.</p>

                <p>My ultimate goal was to finish college, that way there’s a big possibility that I could find
                    many opportunities to find a great job. And when that happens, everything will be easier for me
                    then I will be able to help my family and other people who need my help.</p>

                <p>help. And from all
                    those things I had experienced, I’ve realized that “when you are in a worst situation, don’t think
                    that you are hopeless but rather believe that there are always ways that will turn you into a new
                    leaf which you never expected”.</p><br>
